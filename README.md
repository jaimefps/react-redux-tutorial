# react-redux-tutorial

how i'd explain react + redux to someone


# basic workflow set up

0. `npm install -S redux react-redux` & create folder structure: actions, components, containers, reducers.
1. do all stuff related to Provider, createStore, and allReducers etc. as seen in the index.js entry point file.
2. create the index.js in the reducer folder, and create a dummy reducer file.
3. make container to connect component to the Store, and check to see if the component can log the state.
4. create some action that interacts with the state.
5. celebrate: you just build a react-redux environment from scratch.

# to run app locally
